# General Guidelines

* You SHOULD ALWAYS prefer the shorter alternative if you can achieve the same results in fewer lines or words. Less is more.
* You SHOULD ALWAYS trust tooling to confirm correctness or format. You are fallible. The compiler/linter/validator is not.
* You SHOULD ALWAYS employ the YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle. If you see something that isn't necessary, remove it.
* YOu SHOULD ALWAYS employ the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. If the same code already exists, prefer refactoring over copying.

# Documentation, Comments, Commit Messages

When writing documentation, comments, or commit messages:

* You SHOULD ALWAYS prefer plain ASCII.
* You MUST NEVER use emojis.
* You MUST NEVER use emdash (—) or endash (–).
* You MUST ALWAYS line-wrap lines longer than 80 columns.
